# Youtube_Downloader

Download songs from Youtube the (not so) easy way.

Those scripts add two buttons to the Youtube page under the player. One for direct download of the song and one that can be toggled for auto download. It will automatically download the current song when it ends. When a tab open from youtube-mp3.org you do not need to go in it to manually download the song, it will do it automatically and then close itself. Just click on the button and wait.

Maybe someday I won't be so lazy and provide my own service to download songs and won't use youtube-mp3.org. Or at least make it works without opening tabs like this... I really did this quickly and for my needs, so do not expect much of it.

THIS IS OPTIMISED FOR FIREFOX AND NOT EVEN TESTED ON OTHER BROWSER. IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WORK.

You will need the youtube-mp3.org addon for this to work. You can find it here: http://www.youtube-mp3.org/addons

Load both scripts with GreaseMonkey (http://www.greasespot.net/) and everything should work.

For optimal use and so you don't get annoyed by tab oppening please set the variable "browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground" to True in about:config.
